# SnakeGame

This code uses the Turtle module to create a simple Snake game. 
It handles the movement of the snake, checks for collisions, updates the position of the food, and displays the game on a Turtle graphics window. 
The game starts automatically and listens for arrow key inputs to change the direction of the snake. 
The objective is to grow the snake by eating the green food while avoiding collisions with the boundaries and itself.
